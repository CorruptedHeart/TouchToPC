BB10 App + PC server for using a BB10 device as a networked "mouse".

What started as a simple BlackBerry OS 10 app for changing the song playing on the computer ended up turning into a remote mouse controller.

The system has been developed with two components, a phone app and a computer side "server" program.
The BlackBerry app is developed in C++ and Cascades for the UI while the PC server app has been developed in C#.
Communication between the two is done using sockets over a Wi-Fi connection.
